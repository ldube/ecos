A device driver for the iPAQ UDA1341 Sound Chip
===============================================

THE SOUND DEVICE
----------------------

By default, named '/dev/sound'.

See sound_test.c for examples of usage.

This device supports up to 3 simultaneous users, but no more than 1 per thread.

Every user must set a priority and a new priority will displace an old one.

All sound settings are held independently for each channel.

The UDA1341 is powered up when the first user sets a priority and powered down
 when the last user sets close.

Note the current arrangements to enable this driver to work with and without 
memory protection.

This driver currently only supports sound output - no microphone support is
provided. 

Only basic control of the UDA1341 is provided, cyg_io_lookup, cyg_io_set_config
 to set priority (0 highest, 2 lowest), precision (16, 18, 20 bits), speed 
(8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 32000, 44100, 48000), gain (0 lowest, 99 highest),
flush, close, pause and resume. Only 2 channels and PCM encoding is supported.
